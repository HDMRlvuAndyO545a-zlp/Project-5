## Summary
Hello. Not sure what to say except that I'm a highschool student in his senior year. There isn't much to talk about besides school, all I do is laze around all day. Not much of a sports fan, and I don't like talking that much. I try to be amicable but it's hard since I'm not really a people person.

I may not like sports but T.V. is nice.

## Family
My family is average. A mom and dad pair, and three children. The order is my brother, me, and then my sister with said sister being the youngest. Mom works at a nail salon and, last I checked, dad works as a welder. We don't have the most comfortable lifestyle, but we're living so it's fine.

Currently me and my sister are in high school, meanwhile my brother is having a few difficulties moving out due to various circumstances. Not the perfect family but it's still nice to have them.

## Skills
- Basic HTML knowledge, can make simple websites
- A bit of JavaScript
- Some lab experience

## Hobbies
- Occasionally reading random books I find online. Most of them aren't that great but they're entertaining enough.
- Watching Japanese animation. Sometimes. I have a list of things to watch and it just keeps growing.
- Reading the source material of said animation(s) and having a smug expression because I know what happens later.
- Trying to learn JavaScript and looking it up when it's confusing. Many tabs are opened at such times.
- Being at rest whilst underneath layers of cotton-wool fabric in order to peruse the vast contents of the interwebs via a portable communications device, commonly not used for its intended purpose (Using the phone in bed).
- Writing out of boredom and then getting frustrated when I can't figure out how to transition scenes. 

## Random Facts 
- Eats pretty much anything as long as it tastes decent
