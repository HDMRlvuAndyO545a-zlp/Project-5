    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Hello. Not sure what to say except that I'm a highschool student in his senior year. There isn't much to talk about besides 
        school, all I do is laze around all day. Not much of a sports fan, and I don't like talking that much. I try to be 
        amicable but it's hard since I'm not really a people person.</p>
    </br>
    <p>I may not like sports but T.V. is nice.</p>

    <h2>Family</h2>
    <p>My family is average. A mom and dad pair, and three children. The order is my brother, me, 
        and then my sister with said sister being the youngest. Mom works at a nail salon and, last I checked, dad works as a welder.
         We don't have the most comfortable lifestyle, but we're living so it's fine.</p>
    </br>
    <p>Currently me and my sister are in high school, meanwhile my brother is having a few difficulties moving out due to various 
        circumstances. Not the perfect family but it's still nice to have them.</p>

        <li>Reading the source material of said animation(s) and having a smug expression because I know what happens later.</li>
        <li>Trying to learn JavaScript and looking it up when it's confusing. Many tabs are opened at such times.</li>
        <li>Being at rest whilst underneath layers of cotton-wool fabric in order to peruse the vast contents of the interwebs via 
            a portable communications device, commonly not used for its intended purpose (Using the phone in bed).</li>
        <li>Writing out of boredom and then getting frustrated when I can't figure out how to transition scenes.</li>
